# Detoxify

Detoxify is a Chrome extension designed to remove YouTube Shorts from your feed and search results, providing a streamlined, distraction-free experience. Compatible with all Chromium-based browsers, Detoxify ensures a clean and focused YouTube interface.

Detoxify is currently in the testing phase and requires further improvements. At present, it can hide Shorts from the YouTube feed and search results, though they may reappear after some time. Additionally, once Shorts are hidden, toggling them back on does not always display them correctly.

**Planned Improvements:**

- [ ] Resolve bug preventing Shorts from reappearing after toggling.
- [ ] Add option to filter feed videos based on selected tags.
- [ ] Enhance UI/UX for a more intuitive experience.
- [ ] Introduce an option to hide playables (for YouTube Premium users).
- [ ] Attempt to hide ads on the homepage (fingers crossed!).

These enhancements aim to provide users with greater control over their YouTube experience, focusing on a clean and customizable interface.

# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the use of the Detoxify browser extension, which provides tools for customizing your YouTube experience. This document explains what data we handle, how we handle it, and why. If you have any questions, please contact us at [mrcoder2033d@gmail.com](mailto:mrcoder2033d@gmail.com).

## What Our Extension Does

The extension enhances your YouTube experience by providing the following features:
- Hiding or showing YouTube Shorts.
- Filtering videos based on specific tags.
- Adjusting your YouTube feed for better control over the content you see.

## What Data We Collect

We do **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive user data. All the features in the extension are processed **locally** in your browser. This means:
- We do not track your activity.
- We do not collect any data about the videos you watch, tags you filter, or the preferences you set.
- No information is sent to external servers.

## Permissions We Require

To provide the above features, the extension requires the following browser permissions:

### Access to YouTube Pages
- The extension modifies the YouTube webpage to hide or show Shorts, filter tags, and customize the feed.
- These changes happen entirely in your browser and do not involve any communication with external servers.

### Storage
- The storage permission is used to save your preferences, such as whether Shorts are hidden or which tags to filter.
- All data is stored locally in your browser's storage and does not leave your device.

## How Your Data Is Used

Since we do not collect or transmit any data, there is no data usage to disclose. All operations, including the customization of your YouTube experience, are handled locally within your browser.

## Third-Party Services

Our extension does **not** use any third-party services or APIs to fetch or process data. All functionality is self-contained and operates entirely within your browser environment.

## Security of Your Data

Because no data is collected or transmitted, there is no risk of data breaches or unauthorized access from our extension. Your settings and preferences remain private and secure on your device.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

If we make any updates to this privacy policy, we will update this page and notify users as needed. Changes may include adjustments to permissions, features, or explanations of how the extension works.
